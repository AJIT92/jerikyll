    My first game using OpenGL.
    It is for my computer graphics class in De La Salle University.
    This project took me less than a month for this.
    All 3D models were calculated by hand and hard coded inside.

    My first game written in Java.
    I did not use any graphics library, everything is rendered with Java's Graphics2D and BufferedImage.
    This project took me 2 weeks to produce.
