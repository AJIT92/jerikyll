<p>Hi all, I guess you've all heard about the bad news [<a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/gregaman/blog/2011/07/18/a_message_from_capcom">link</a>, <a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/official_capcom_blog/blog/2011/07/19/to_the_devroom_and_legends_3_fans_everywhere">link</a>].
	It's been about 3 months since my last update... and currently, I still have no updates to share.
	It's not because I'm too busy with my job, but because... nothing, I just wanted to relax a little bit. hahaha!
	Anyway, I guess break time's over for me, I can't just leave us Mega Man Legends fans like this now, can I?
	I'll start dedicating my weekends to this game right away! YAY for us!</p>
