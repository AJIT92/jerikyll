<p>Finally! a video update after so long.</p>

<p>First, we have Data! YAY!... well, you probably know that already if you follow my <a href="https://plus.google.com/117197579030508718795/posts/XwWu3qhJ9HW">Google+</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jericbryledy/status/103476964828004352">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=258311070860125&set=a.258311067526792.73519.128482537176313">Facebook Page</a>.</p>

<p>Next, Mega Man now gets his falling and getting up animations. Yes, that means he can now fall... well obviously lol.</p>

<p>Next, I've added Fire and Ice effetcs to Fire and Ice Horokkos respectively.</p>

{% include image.html caption="this Fire Horokko seems to be kind of lost in the snow field" image_url="/images/games/rockmandashfangame/fire-horokko.png" %}

<p>Next, I've already added the purple refractor, haven't added the other colors yet though, maybe next update I will.</p>

<p>Lastly, and most importantly I need a music man.
	The game's gonna be boring without background music.
	I don't want to reuse the music from the actual game.
	I need someone who can compose music that gives the same feeling as those from the original music of the game (if you know what I mean).
	If you think you're that kind of person, or knows someone like that contact me ASAP.</p>

<p>... And here's the vid! Enjoy!</p>
