				<p>Recently, I have been thinking of creating another Rockman DASH fan game.
					This time, I will need help in creating the 3D models for the game, so hopefully it won't suck as the one I have done previously [<a href="http://www.jericdy.com/jerigames/rockmandash3fangame">link</a>].
					If you think you can help, click <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGYxZU45VkVJSGQybEZBYjVjdTczRmc6MA">here</a>.</p>


				<p>Why? Since Capcom still show no signs of interest in creating the third installment.
					I thought why not create a fan game for the meantime to entertain the fans?</p>
