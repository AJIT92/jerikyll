<p>Hi all, it has been 6 months since my last update.
	I've been receiving messages from you guys wondering if I have lost interest in this project.
	The answer is no.
	I just have been very busy in my academic works (e.g. Master's Thesis).
	I am updating once in a while when I have some time in my hands.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots from the current game...</p>

{% include image.html image_url="/images/games/rockmandashfangame/rm-jump-ani.png" %}

<p>As you can see, Mega Man can now jump. I have also updated the his texture.</p>

{% include image.html image_url="/images/games/rockmandashfangame/rm-land-ani.png" %}

<p>This is Mega Man landing from a jump facing the camera.</p>

{% include image.html image_url="/images/games/rockmandashfangame/rm-shoot-ani.png" %}

<p>And finally, the shoot animation... nothing is coming out of the buster as of the moment. haha.</p>


<p>Why just screenshots?
	Well, I've tried recording the game but it was too choppy.
	Recording a game takes a lot of resources and my computer can't handle it.
	Not to worry though, I'll try recording this in someone else's computer and upload it as soon as I can.</p>

<p>To the ones who are sending me message, KEEP THEM COMING!
	It's great to see someone is interested in this project. haha. That's all for now.</p>
