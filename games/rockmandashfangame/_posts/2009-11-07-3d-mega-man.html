				<p>After 3 sleepless nights, I was finally able to create a 3D model Mega Man for the game [image on the left]<p>

				<p>Ok, I still have to UV map, create a texture and create armatures for this thing. It will probably take me another few days for me to do it since Iâ€™m not a 3D artist in the first place.</p>

				<p>Note: From this post onwards I will refer to him as Mega Man, not Rockman, since I will be releasing this game in English.</p>
