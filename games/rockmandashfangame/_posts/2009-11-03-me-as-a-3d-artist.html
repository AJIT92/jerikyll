<p>Ok since I can’t get my hands on any mesh to work with. I will make the mesh myself as of the moment. I have done some 3D modeling in the past though, but I’m just not that confident with my work. If you think you can help with the meshes feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>Once I get or made the meshes I need, I will set the project status to active and start announcing my progress. I really want to finish or at least make this game playable before I start taking my thesis in my studies.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to know, here is a list of what I will be using for this project.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Language</td>
			<td>C++</td>

		<tr>
			<td>Graphics Library</td>
			<td>DirectX 9</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3D Modeling Software</td>
			<td>Blender</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
