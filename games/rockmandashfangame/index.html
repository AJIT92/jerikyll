			<p>
				This is simply my favorite hobby/fan game project.
				I started this project in 2009 with the intention to learn the underlying of 3D Game Development.
				Of course, if I simply use a game engine, I would end up with a better looking game in only a couple of weeks.
				I ended up learning a lot of things, like how to implement skinning, height map, how sounds work and so on.
			</p>

				One of the common questions I get asked is why I chose DirectX over OpenGL.
				Well, it's really just curiosity.
				At that time, I just learned <a href="/games/graphix/">OpenGL on my computer graphics class</a>, so I thought why not try using DirectX this time.
				That's it. Anyway, the playlist above is the evolution of my fan game. Enjoy!
