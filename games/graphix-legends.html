			<p>This is my project in my computer graphics class (GRAPHIX) in DLSU which is made in C++ and OpenGL. It is an imitation of the RockMan DASH / MegaMan Legends game. The game was created in April 2008, took me less than a month.</p>

			<p>DISCLAIMER: This is just a fan made game. I don't own Rockman / Mega Man in any way. Capcom is its rightful owner. I used the YouTube's AudioSwap Feature for the audio of this video, tell me if you like it or not.</p>
