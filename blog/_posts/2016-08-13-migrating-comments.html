<p>
	I have decided to migrate my comments section from Blogger's to Disqus's.
	I also wanted to preserve all my previous comments,
		so I've placed a button to at the bottom of the page to show the Blogger comments.
	If I do this to all post, even my new posts will have a Blogger comment option.
	So I've set a date, say January 1, 2016,
		everything before the said date will have the button appear.
</p>

<p>
	I soon realized I can't compare the page's timestamp to a hard-coded timestamp
</p>

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% if page.date < "2016-01-01 00:00:00 +0000" %}
    ...stuff...
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	I have tried every possible permutation even ISO format.
	I always end up with the error:
</p>

{% highlight properties %}
Liquid Exception: Liquid error (line 27): comparison of Time with Liquid::Token failed in _layouts/post.html error:
Error: Liquid error (line 27): comparison of Time with Liquid::Token failed
Error: Run jekyll build --trace for more information.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	It turns out, I should have assigned the timestamp to a page variable before comparing it.
	This way, jekyll will cast it as a timestamp instead of string.
</p>

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
blogger-timestamp: 2016-01-01 00:00:00 +0000

{% if page.date < blogger-timestamp %}
    ...stuff...
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_thumbnail="800x600" image_file="disqus-comments.jpg" caption="Option to show old comments at the bottom" %}

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_thumbnail="800x600" image_file="blogger-comments.jpg" caption="Blogger comments from my <a href='/blog/2015/01/04/3d-printer.html'>3D Printer post</a>" %}

<p>
	I initially hard-coded it just to do a quick test,
		but ended up spending about an hour trying to figure out how to compare timestamps in Jekyll.
	Only to realize it's because I am comparing a timestamp to a string!.
	Oh well, all's well that ends well, I guess.
