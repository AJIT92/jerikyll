<p>
	Today, I receive a surprise from Google! I received this...
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_thumbnail="800x600" image_file="adwords-voucher.png" %}

<p>
	1,500PHP worth of Google AdWords free advertising voucher!
	Woohoo! Google loves me! For the <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/bible/">bible</a> tells me so.
	It will drop it's value to 1,000PHP on Sept 30, 2010 if unused and will expire on Oct 15, 2010 if still unused.
	My problem is that my site doesn't offer products or services.
	What am I gonna advertise for?
	I still have less than a week to think about this.
