<p>
	I'm so stressed out today (private matters).
	But everything turned around when my phone rang.
	I looked at it and it was from an unknown caller.
	I answered it anyway, and the caller told me they have a job opening and asking if I'm interested.
	He told me he works for a multi-billion dollar company and is asking me if I'm ok with a "No Strings Attached" job.
</p>

<p>
	Ok, it's obviously a pyramiding scam, but I love it when these guys call me.
	I get the chance to make a fool out of them. Anyway, the conversation goes on like this…
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Caller:</b></td>
			<td>Blah blah blah (describing his imaginary company for like 1-2 minutes)</td>

	He sure knows how to curse, haha.
	Clearly this isn't my first time making a fool out of them, but today's timing was perfect.
	I need to throw my stress away and here comes this guy waiting to be thrown at.
	Now I want a phone that can record my conversations so I can share them with you. haha.
	Anyway, be careful with these scammers, here are some tips you should know:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>They will mention that they're a billion-dollar/ multi-billion-dollar/ multi-something or something similar kind of company.</li>
	<li>They will mention "No Strings Attached".</li>
	<li>Won't tell you their company name (because they have none) [some will tell you a fake company name]</li>
	<li>If their "name" is unfamiliar, try asking for their website. Most companies now have their own websites (and these scammers have none).</li>
	<li>If you did managed to schedule for an "interview", the scammer won't mention that you need to bring your resume/CV.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	And if you're confident enough that you're talking to a scammer.
	Do what I do! Make them cry! HAHA!
