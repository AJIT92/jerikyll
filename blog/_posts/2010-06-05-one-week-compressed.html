<p>
	I wasn't able to blog last week because my old Bluetooth dongle device broke (about 5 years of usage).
	So today, I bought a new one.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="bluetooth-dongle.jpg" %}

<p>
	I don't want to blog without photos.
	It's hard for me to describe things with words.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, I've finally managed to buy epoxy (for those of you who don't know why, <a href="/blog/2010/05/26/unrepair-man.html">click here</a>).
	So once again, I opened my laptop's case.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="msi-vr340-internal-2.jpg" %}

<p>
	removed the connections from the LCD.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="msi-vr340-lcd-separate.jpg" %}

<p>
	and finally applied the epoxy to the hinge and all other cracks.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="msi-vr340-epoxy-2.jpg" %}

<p>
	While I was waiting for the epoxy to harden, I got too happy with it and started to find things that needs bonding.
	First, I remembered I accidentally dropped my <a href="/blog/2010/05/25/goodbye-mosquitoes.html">mosquito pester</a> a few days back and broke one of its four leg.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="mosquito-pester-4.jpg" %}

<p>
	So I applied the epoxy to it.
	Next, I remembered the handle of my mom's pan cracked a few weeks ago.
	So again I applied epoxy to it.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="frying-pan-epoxy-2.jpg" %}

<p>
	And look! I found a 3D puzzle! hahaha. The blender jar's bottom part shattered into pieces.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="blender-jar-broken-1.jpg" %}

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="blender-jar-broken-2.jpg" %}

<p>
	Unfortunately, just when I was about to begin applying epoxy I found a huge crack at the upper part.
	We wouldn't want to eat stuff that has been blended with epoxy right?
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="blender-jar-broken-3.jpg" %}

<p>
	So the next day I hurriedly went to my laptop.
	I screw everything into place and the moment I lift the LCD, the epoxy went up with it. hahaha.
	It turns out that the case's surface paint is too smooth that the epoxy doesn't have enough grip.
</p>

<p>
	For the second round, I scratched on the case's surface with a screw driver to have enough grip and friction for the epoxy.
	This time, I applied a little bit more epoxy just in case.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="msi-vr340-keyboard.jpg" %}

<p>
	While waiting and having some excess epoxy.
	I've decided to make a ball out of it for fun
	...and eventually just made my 10 fingers sticked together.
	I don't have a picture of it, I don't want to touch my phone that time.
	Anyway, when I was washing my hands I saved some epoxy along with it, turned it into a ball and placed it on my tall chair (sometimes used as table) immediately.
</p>

{% include image.html image_path="/images/blog" image_file="epoxy-ball.jpg" %}

<p>
	The next day, I tried lifting the LCD and everything was fine.
	Fine until 10 hours later when my little sister lift the LCD and cracked the epoxy. hahaha.
	I will not attempt to repair the hinge with epoxy anymore.
	I'll just find another way.
</p>

<p>
	Hmm... let's see what else can I remember...
	I got my non-pro driving license...
</p>

<p>
	I've also bought my own domain, you can visit it at <a href="http://www.jericbryledy.com">www.jericbryledy.com</a>...
</p>

<p>
	I saw a very inspiring video about a REAL hero <a href="http://en.tackfilm.se/?id=1275493731089RA82">here</a>...
</p>

<p>
	And... I don't know anymore. hahaha
